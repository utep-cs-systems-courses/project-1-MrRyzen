Project 1: Tokenizer
====================
#Usage:

Commands prefix !
 - !e exits
 - !a prints all history
 - !n where n is an integer pertaining to the histor
 - anything else is an invalid command

Make
 - Make clean to clean files
 - Running make then running mainUI runs the program

Lastly typing any sentence will run the tokenizer in the program and echo it
back
All commands are echoed back

# Instructions:

You should document your tokenizer in this file.

This file is written in the refreshingly simple `markdown` text
formatting language.
